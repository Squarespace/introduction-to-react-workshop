## 05 Profile Context

In this step, the code we are writing is within these files:
`src/App.js`
`components/ProfileGrid.js`
`components/SearchForm.js`
`provider/ProfileProvider.js`
`hooks/useProfileState.js`

In this step we extract the profile state into context through
the `ProfileProvider`, and access it with a hook.
