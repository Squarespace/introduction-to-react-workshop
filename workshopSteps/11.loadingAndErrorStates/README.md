## 11 Loading and Error States

In this step, the code we are writing is within these files:
`src/components/ProfileGrid.js`
`src/components/SearchForm.js`
`src/providers/ProfileProvider.js`

BEGIN and END comments indicate what code has changed.

In this step we are adding loading and error states to the UI
in response to the async calls we are making to the server.
